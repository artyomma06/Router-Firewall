Final Project: Implementing a Simple Router
For this assignment we created a ipv4 topology consisting of 11 hosts and 6 switches. We were also given a set of rules we were required to follow for hosts communication. Personally I used three helper functions a drop a flood and a sender and used the source/destination IP address in order to follow the rules provided. In order to test my topology and my controller I used both iperf and pingall. Files present: README.txt(file describing files being submitted), project.pdf(file with detailed explanation of project), final_skel.py(code for assembling the topology), finalcontroller_skel.py(code for controlling the topology).
